        <h2>Geneticist Krystal Tsosie advocates for Indigenous data sovereignty</h2>
        <p>Tsosie returned to Arizona State to work on a master’s degree in bioethics with the intention of going to law school. But the more she learned about how much genetic research relies on big data and how those data are shared and used, the more Tsosie realized there was a huge need for Indigenous geneticists.

Around the world, scientific use of Indigenous genetic data has led to repeated violations of rights and sovereignty. For example, beginning in 1990, Havasupai Tribal members gave DNA samples to researchers from ASU, hoping to understand more about diabetes in their community. Researchers eventually used the Havasupai DNA in a range of studies, including for research on schizophrenia and alcoholism, which the Havasupai say they had not been properly informed about or consented to. </p>

        <h2>A new exhibit invites you into the ‘Secret World of Elephants’</h2>
        <p>For millions of years, over a dozen species of proboscideans, the group that includes mammoths, mastodons and elephants, roamed landscapes as varied as Arctic tundra and African savannas. Then, around 11,700 years ago, as the last ice age waned and human hunting picked up, this number dwindled to just three: the Asian elephant, the African forest elephant and the African savanna elephant — all of which are now endangered.

Losing elephants comes with a far-reaching and underappreciated impact, warns “The Secret World of Elephants.” The exhibit, now on display at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, explores that impact, as well as what modern science is revealing about elephant minds and bodies.

        <h2>Bacteria fossils hold the oldest signs of machinery needed for photosynthesis</h2>
        <p>Ancient tiny fossils from Australia may carry evidence of great power: the ability to make oxygen through photosynthesis.

The fossilized bacteria, dating from 1.73 billion to 1.78 billion years ago, are chock-full of structures that resemble those where oxygen-producing photosynthesis takes place in most modern cyanobacteria and in plants. Called thylakoid membranes, the structures are the oldest ever found, researchers report January 3 in Nature. The finding pushes back the evidence of thylakoids in cyanobacteria by 1.2 billion years.</p>

        <h2>Electrical brain implants may help patients with severe brain injuries</h2>
        <p>For people with traumatic brain injuries, cognitive functions like memory, attention and mood regulation can become exceedingly difficult. But “there is no therapy for this kind of problem, even though it’s so prevalent,” says Nicholas Schiff, a neurologist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City.

Now, in a small study of individuals who have suffered moderate to severe brain injury, five patients scored better on a test of attention and information processing after having electrodes surgically implanted into the thalamus, an early stop for information coming in through the senses, Schiff and colleagues report December 4 in Nature Medicine. The study participants and their families also reported improvements in their symptoms and daily lives after deep brain stimulation.</p>

        <h2>The mysterious deaths of dozens of Zimbabwe’s elephants has been solved</h2>
        <p>Three years ago, dozens of African elephants mysteriously died in Zimbabwe. Now scientists have confirmed their killer: a rare and little-known bacterium that can cause organ inflammation leading to deadly hemorrhaging.

The bacterium, dubbed Pasteurellaceae Bisgaard taxon 45, turned up in samples from six of 15 elephants analyzed, researchers report October 25 in Nature Communications. The pathogen is closely related to Pasteurella multocida, which is known to cause hemorrhagic septicemia, or fatal blood poisoning, but Bisgaard taxon 45 had not been previously implicated in such infections.  </p>

            <p>Government policymakers’ attention these days is on creating hypothetical worst-case scenarios on the peril of artificial intelligence (AI) across various industries. Some even suggest there’s an existential risk to humanity. In Washington, hearings on AI always seem to reach the same conclusion—more government intrusion and regulation is needed, even before we understand what this technology can do. Such intrusion could stifle the promise of AI at the beginning, leaving other countries, such as China, to take the lead.</p>

            <h2>How Technology Can Be A Tool For Transparency In Public Safety</h2>
            <p>If you watch the news or read the morning headlines, you’re sure to be bombarded with calls for increased transparency from government and public safety agencies.

There is plenty of information the public would like to easily access: daily crime reports mapped and made available online; traffic cameras that give drivers a sneak peek at their commute; offender registries detailing where the worst released convicts live; and video and audio from body and dashboard cameras.

Creating greater transparency, given all this available data, is a complicated, multifaceted initiative. To be successful, it requires several layers of technology to provide the needed insights that could lead to positive change in community relations</p>

            <h2>Arm shares soar on rising demand for AI technology</h2>
            <p>The market value of the chip designer Arm has risen by more than a fifth in pre-market trading after the UK-based tech company beat revenue expectations, citing a recovery in the smartphone market and high demand for artificial intelligence technology.

Shares in Arm, the world’s biggest supplier of design elements for the processing chips used in products from smartphones to games consoles, gained more than 22% before the opening of Nasdaq in the US on Thursday.

The Cambridge-headquartered company, which snubbed the UK when its parent company, SoftBank, floated the business in September, has a market capitalisation of $80bn (£63bn).

Rene Haas, Arm’s chief executive, said on Wednesday the company was benefiting from the “profound opportunity” brought by the demand from tech firms to release products and apps underpinned by AI.</p>
